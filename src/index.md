Hi! My name is Elisei Zanko, also known as `31z4` or `e1z4` on systems that don't allow starting names from a number.

I am a solopreneur and an Open Source maintainer. I've been into programming and computers since 1999. I love sports,
photography, and being outside, especially with my family and friends.

Most of the time, I write about technical stuff here. Sometimes, I post my photographs.

I currently work on [mintee.app](https://mintee.app) â€“ a minimalist time tracker.
