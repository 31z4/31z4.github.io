title: How I Won Three Hackathons in a Row
---

## {{ title }}

From June 2023 to March 2024, I participated in three hackathons as a solo hacker and took prizes in all three. In this post, I share my thoughts on what I believe have been the main drivers of my success.

For the context, all hackathons were online, related to [Web3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web3), and co-organized by [Protocol Labs](https://protocol.ai).
As for my background, from 2015 to 2022, I participated in four hackathons (two onsite and two online). My team and I won two of them.

This time, I was hacking solo, and here is what I think helped me succeed.

**I was building for myself**

In two cases out of three, I was solving my own problem.
To be more specific, two of my projects were related to (now discontinued) [Saturn](https://saturn.tech) â€“ a community-run distributed content delivery network (CDN) for Web3.
I was interested in the project, ran a node, and saw a lack of observability in the Saturn network.
So, I built better observability tools. Tools that I needed myself.

My motivation for the third project was learning about blockchain scaling solutions and getting hands-on experience with sophisticated Solidity contracts.

**I was laser-focused on shipping a minimum viable product**

I aimed to ship from day one.
I often asked myself, _"What's the minimum amount of engineering required to implement the very initial version of the feature `X`? What can I not do to narrow the scope of work?"_
And then, on every iteration, I strived to have something working and available for others to try.
It balanced my perfectionism, protected me from over-engineering, and helped me gather feedback early.

**I engaged with the community and sought feedback**

With every subsequent hackathon, I was more active in the community.
I asked questions, submitted pull requests, demonstrated prototypes, and asked for feedback.
It's hard to overestimate the benefits of interacting with the community and your potential customers.

**I worked almost full-time**

As a solopreneur, I had the luxury of dedicating most of my work time to a hackathon project.
This way, I had time to research technology and tools relevant to my project and time to build a product that was looking good enough.

Yet maintaining motivation and focus was a bit of a challenge for one hackathon that lasted a month. Having a break and switching to other projects for a few days helped me finish and submit.

**I was selling**

In a video presentation for judges, I focused on defining the problem and explaining how my project solves it.
I preferred to leave most of the technical details behind the scenes, in the `README` file within the project's GitHub repository ([example](https://github.com/cronian-tech/saturn-observatory?tab=readme-ov-file#-how-its-made)).
Demonstrating how the project works was a crucial part, too.

_P.S. For those who are interested, here is the list of my hackathon submissions: [one](https://ethglobal.com/showcase/saturn-moonlet-c4583), [two](https://github.com/cronian-tech/saturn-observatory), and [three](https://dorahacks.io/buidl/10858)._
