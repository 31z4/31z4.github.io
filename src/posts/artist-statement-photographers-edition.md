I've been passionate about photography since childhood.
In 2022, I wrote my artist statement to apply to an art residency in Morocco.

> "My photography is subjective.
>
> I am fascinated not by documentary and realism but, on the contrary, by the opportunity to capture the subjective projection of the current moment of time and space. However, subjectivity does not deny the object in the frame.
>
> When I get a chance, I become a thoughtful and attentive observer. When finding a frame and a suitable shooting point, I'm unhurried.
>
> In other circumstances, I rely on intuition and reflexes. Acting quickly, I trust the subconscious and believe in luck.
>
> Regardless of the external conditions, a moment before making a shot, my attention and concentration reach their limit to convey what I see and what I feel.
>
> I have no expectations about the photographs I take. But I'm sincerely happy and surprised if the picture turns out to be good. If it does, then it conveys my feelings and observations.
>
> Moving away from realism, I sometimes experiment with a focus point and exposure. Overexposed pictures are like paintings. And paintings inspire me a lot!
>
> I'm as interested in people as in trees.
>
> In other words, I tend to observe and study both the surrounding nature and humans. The human body, human personality, and humans in general - the creator of cities and settlements, mechanisms and machines, works of art."

_P.S. If programming is an art, do programmers write their artist statement?_
