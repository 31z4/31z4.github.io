      <p>Hi! My name is Elisei Zanko, also known as <code>31z4</code> or <code>e1z4</code> on systems that don't allow starting names from a number.</p>
<p>I am a solopreneur and an Open Source maintainer. I've been into programming and computers since 1999. I love sports, photography, and being outside, especially with my family and friends.</p>
<p>Most of the time, I write about technical stuff here. Sometimes, I post my photographs.</p>
