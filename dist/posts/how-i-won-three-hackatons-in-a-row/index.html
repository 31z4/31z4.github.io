  <h2>How I Won Three Hackathons in a Row</h2>
  <time datetime="2024-10-02">Oct 2, 2024</time>
  <p>From June 2023 to March 2024, I participated in three hackathons as a solo hacker and took prizes in all three. In this post, I share my thoughts on what I believe have been the main drivers of my success.</p>
<p>For the context, all hackathons were online, related to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web3">Web3</a>, and co-organized by <a href="https://protocol.ai">Protocol Labs</a>.
As for my background, from 2015 to 2022, I participated in four hackathons (two onsite and two online). My team and I won two of them.</p>
<p>This time, I was hacking solo, and here is what I think helped me succeed.</p>
<p><strong>I was building for myself</strong></p>
<p>In two cases out of three, I was solving my own problem.
To be more specific, two of my projects were related to (now discontinued) <a href="https://saturn.tech">Saturn</a> â€“ a community-run distributed content delivery network (CDN) for Web3.
I was interested in the project, ran a node, and saw a lack of observability in the Saturn network.
So, I built better observability tools. Tools that I needed myself.</p>
<p>My motivation for the third project was learning about blockchain scaling solutions and getting hands-on experience with sophisticated Solidity contracts.</p>
<p><strong>I was laser-focused on shipping a minimum viable product</strong></p>
<p>I aimed to ship from day one.
I often asked myself, &quot;What's the minimum amount of engineering required to implement the very initial version of the feature <code>X</code>? What can I <em>not do</em> to narrow the scope of work?&quot;
And then, on every iteration, I strived to have something working and available for others to try.
It balanced my perfectionism, protected me from over-engineering, and helped me gather feedback early.</p>
<p><strong>I engaged with the community and sought feedback</strong></p>
<p>With every subsequent hackathon, I was more active in the community.
I asked questions, submitted pull requests, demonstrated prototypes, and asked for feedback.
It's hard to overestimate the benefits of interacting with the community and your potential customers.</p>
<p><strong>I worked almost full-time</strong></p>
<p>As a solopreneur, I had the luxury of dedicating most of my work time to a hackathon project.
This way, I had time to research technology and tools relevant to my project and time to build a product that was looking good enough.</p>
<p>Yet maintaining motivation and focus was a bit of a challenge for one hackathon that lasted a month. Having a break and switching to other projects for a few days helped me finish and submit.</p>
<p><strong>I was selling</strong></p>
<p>In a video presentation for judges, I focused on defining the problem and explaining how my project solves it.
I preferred to leave most of the technical details behind the scenes, in the <code>README</code> file within the project's GitHub repository (<a href="https://github.com/cronian-tech/saturn-observatory?tab=readme-ov-file#-how-its-made">example</a>).
Demonstrating how the project works was a crucial part, too.</p>
<p><em>P.S. For those who are interested, here is the list of my hackathon submissions: <a href="https://ethglobal.com/showcase/saturn-moonlet-c4583">one</a>, <a href="https://github.com/cronian-tech/saturn-observatory">two</a>, and <a href="https://dorahacks.io/buidl/10858">three</a>.</em></p>
